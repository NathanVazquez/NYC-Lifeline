GeoApify only lets us see city level location, thus we need to use Browser Geo Location

tutorial for Browser Geo Location--> https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp

Note: As of Chrome 50, the Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts such as HTTPS. If your site is hosted on an non-secure origin (such as HTTP) the requests to get the users location will no longer function.
